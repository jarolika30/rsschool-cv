**Address**: 

    Belarus, Gomel  
	Yubileynaya 13/18, 246028  
			 
**My goal**: to obtain a Front-end Developer position.  
```
	My main professional interest is Web technologies. I like it, because
Web technologies offer powerful possibilities to make websites, web applications
and it is the best way to implement my ideas. Among a large numbers of programming  
languages I prefer JavaScript. It allows not only to create beautiful and interactive 
projects, but also can be used on the server side.
	At the moment, I am familiar with JavaScript, NodeJS, Sass, React. I implemented some projects 
using them. I want to develop in this area and to be able to write code better and more  
efficiently.
	My professional background was connected with teaching. On my previous job I have got 
such important skills as patience, responsibility and although I learned not to be afraid 
of any difficulties. In addition, I can teach others and learn by myself. In my mind it is 
very important for an IT-specialist to be a quick learner. Live and learn - it's about me. 
I like to face new challenges  and to get new skill set. I have received software
engineer qualification at Sukhoi University and finished The Rolling Scopes School with
certificate in 2019. Now I am ready to work hard and use all my knowledge in real 
Web Development projects.
