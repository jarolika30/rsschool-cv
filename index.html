            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p><strong>My goal:</strong> to obtain a Front-end Developer position.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>My main professional interest</strong> is Web technologies. I like it, because
              Web technologies offer powerful possibilities to make websites, web applications
              and it is the best way to implement my ideas. Among a large numbers of programming
              languages I prefer JavaScript. It allows not only to create beautiful and interactive
              projects, but also can be used on the server side.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the moment, I am familiar with <strong>JavaScript, NodeJS, Sass, React</strong>. I implemented some projects
              using them. I want to develop in this area and to be able to write code better and more
              efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>My professional background</strong> was connected with teaching. On my previous job I have got 
              such important skills as patience, responsibility and although I learned not to be afraid 
              of any difficulties. In addition, I can teach others and learn by myself. In my mind it is 
              very important for an IT-specialist to be a quick learner. Live and learn - it's about me. 
              I like to face new challenges  and to get new skill set. I have received <strong>software
              engineer</strong> qualification at <strong>Sukhoi University</strong> in 2018 and finished <strong>
              The Rolling Scopes School</strong> with certificate in 2019. Now I am ready to work hard and 
              use all my knowledge in real Web Development projects.
